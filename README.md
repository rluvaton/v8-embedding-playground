# v8-embedding-playground

Follow:
1. [V8 Docs - Checking out V8 Source Code](https://v8.dev/docs/source-code#using-git)
2. [V8 Docs - Embed](https://v8.dev/docs/embed) for setting up 

for me somehow I had a v8 folder inside v8 folder so this might mess with the relative path in the scripts inside `my-playground`

## Start:
Add the `my-playground` folder under `samples` folder
and good luck
